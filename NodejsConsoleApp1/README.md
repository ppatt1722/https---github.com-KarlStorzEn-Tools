# NodejsConsoleApp1
This is a first project. Starting off with some snippets to get working before putting it all together.

I need to test:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx
(uses Excel 2007)
https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston

I will need to do these things very soon like today maybe or yesterday:

parse file data for results
use regular expressions to extract data from strings
output csv
read in csv and output xlsx
read in a mapping from xlsx and create a lookup table

Node.js tutorial is here:
